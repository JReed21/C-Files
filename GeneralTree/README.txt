The zip contains three files. There is the main.cpp file, GeneralTree.h file, and GeneralTree.cpp file

Main.cpp just runs a bunch of different commands testing GeneralTree and all of its methods. Additional tests may be added for edge
casing if desired. More info is in the comments.

GeneralTree.h is the skeleton of the GeneralTree object. It contains at its core a Node that has two variables: a char value and a list
object of more Nodes denoted children. The rest of the tree contains methods to create a N-ary Tree with no static number of children
More info is in the comments.

GeneralTree.cpp is the blood and meat of the General Tree. It brings life to all of the empty methods of the interface file. Each method
is explained more thoroughly in the comments.
